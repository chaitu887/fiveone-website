For example, if an automaker is pursuing a niche luxury market, its ads should be crafted to appeal to that market and should appear on channels and sites where potential customers are likely to see them.</p><p class="text-muted mr-4"><b>Identify its customers:</b> Conducting surveys, convening focus groups, and holding one-on-one interviews can help a company identify its consumer group.<br><b>Determine the personality and message it wants to communicate:</b> A company needs to create a consistent perception, rather than trying to combine every conceivable positive trait: utility, affordability, quality, nostalgia, modernity, luxury, flash, taste, and class. All elements of a brand, such as copy, imagery, cultural allusions, and color schemes, should align and deliver a coherent message.</p></div></div><div class="col-lg-5"><div class="agency-service-img mt-4"><img src="assets/images/service-img/img-2.jpg" class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto"></div></div></div></div><div class="tab-pane fade" id="dynamic-growth" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="dynamic-growth-tab"><div class="row align-items-center"><div class="col-lg-7"><div class="service-desc pt-4"><h3 class="text-dark mb-4">Bussiness Community</h3><p class="text-muted pr-4">The four key features of a community business are:<br><b>Locally rooted:</b> They are rooted in a particular geographical place and respond to its needs. For example, that could be high levels of urban deprivation or rural isolation.<br><b>Trading for the benefit of the local community:</b> They are businesses. Their income comes from things like renting out space in their buildings, trading as cafes, selling produce they grow or generating energy.</p><p class="text-muted pr-4"><b>Accountable to the local community:</b> They are accountable to local people, for example through a community shares offer that creates members who have a voice in the business’s direction.<br><b>Broad community impact:</b> They benefit and impact their local community as a whole.
